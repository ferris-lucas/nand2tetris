# nand2tetris - Build a computer from its fundamental blocks
This repository contains the files I created during a computer architecture course [Nand2Tetris](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer). Skills learned: Digital Logic | Computer Architecture | Assembly Language | Hardware Description Language (HDL) | CPU Operation | ALU Operation | Types of Instructions | Random Access Memory.
* [Various Chips used to implement a von Neumann Architecture](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/chips): AND gate, OR Gate, NOT Gate, XOR Gate, Multiplexer, Demultiplexer.
* [Combine Chips to create an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/ALU): Combine previous chips to create a Halfadder, Fulladder and an ALU.
* [Combine Chips to crete a Register and expand to RAM](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/RAM): Combine previous chips to create a Register and Program Counter(PC) unit and use it to create a RAM.
* [Use assembly language to implement a multiplication operation](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/assembly_multiplication)
* [Use previous implementations to create a computer](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/complete_basic_computer): ROM + CPU + MEMORY.
* [Stack Arithmetic with assembly language](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/stack_arithmetic): Use assembly to implement a stack with PUSH and POP operations on RAM.
* [For Loop and Fibonacci sequence in assembly](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/assembly_for_loop)
* [Implement an assembler using Python](https://github.com/ferris77/nand2tetris/tree/main/python): Simple code in Python that reads a file with programming instructions and converts it to assembly.
